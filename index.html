    <h2>PERSONAL SUMMARY</h2>

    <p>
      I am a hardworking and reliable university graduate with a relentless
      passion for self-improvement. I received a Bachelor of Science in Software
      Engineering and Game Development from Lancaster University while running a
      successful part-time business, which I ran alongside full-time jobs. I am

      excellently as a team which reflects in my grades, accolades and
